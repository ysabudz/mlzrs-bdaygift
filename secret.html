		<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;"> Hello :) <br><br><br>
This might come as a surprise, but I felt it was important to be honest with you—it's become something I can't easily keep to myself. 
<br><br><br>
<b>I like you, Marie.</b>
<br><br><br>
If you have read the other letter, you do know that you hold a special place in my heart because of this unique bond that we formed that I don't know how to define. There are many moments where I thought that maybe,<i> just maybe, </i> these certain actions or words had a meaning beyond a simple friendship. I would catch myself overthinking such moments that it becomes annoying as my head was just filled with you and whenever I tried to stop it, I just keep falling back to this. Even with these feelings, please know that everything I've said and done has come not just from this certain kind of affection, but also from the fact that you are one of the closest people in my life right now. It might sound crazy, but I truly value our connection and don't want to lose it as we move forward. 
<br><br>
I can enumerate the moments and talk for a long time on how this started, but I want to let you know that this feeling was explored around the start of the year but probably slowly bloomed before it. I was the one who left the purple rose on your seat, the first flower you received for Valentine's Day. I asked you to be my waltz partner because I wanted to explore the possibility of something more, and also, of course, making memories with you. 
<br><br>
While physical touch had not led to such romantic feelings for me before, the times you would hug me or hold my hand gave me these goddamn butterflies. I often tried to stay composed, but I worried my feelings might have been obvious, transparent as day. Lately, these feelings have intensified; I've found myself feeling jealous at times when I should not be, and I wait for your messages and get concerned when you don't reply. <b> In short, I like you so much to the point I will combust if I continue keeping this for so long and just let it die without ever telling you. </b>
<br><br>
I know about your boundaries when it comes to this, but I'm not looking for an answer nor a reciprocal of this feeling. My main intention is to be transparent with you as you are my safe space; I don't want a wall between us. I have been contemplating about this confession for a while now as I didn't want to lose what we have at the moment. However, I chose to do so because in the words of the people I told my situation to, we act as <i>"more than friends but less than lovers,"</i> making me want to reevaluate this relationship we have. 
<br><br>
I understand if you need space to process this, but don't avoid me, please? I am always open for conversations, you know that, no matter how deep and personal it is. I also want to graduate still by your side because you being my crush or not doesn't change the fact we faced and survived this last year in high school together and all that I have said in the other letter. Thank you for the rollercoaster of emotions, Marie. I sincerely mean all that I have said, especially when I said "I love you"<i>—because I do</i>.
<br><br><br>

Loving you always, <br>
Ysa </p>
